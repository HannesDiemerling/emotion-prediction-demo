# Emotion Prediction Demo

ScienceNightApp is a Tkinter-based application that demonstrates an emotion recognition workflow using the [RAVDESS dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976). The app randomly plays video clips, lets you select emotions, and provides visual feedback by displaying a mask that highlights the facial areas most important to the trained model. All results are compiled into a leaderboard, gamifying the experience.

## Features

- **Video Playback:** Random selection and playback of video clips from the RAVDESS dataset.
- **Emotion Recognition:** Choose an emotion to check if it matches the correct one.
- **Visualization:** Displays a mask image (MaskeRAVDESS) that highlights key facial areas for the model. These need to be generated with the trained model directly.
- **User Management:** Create new users and track statistics (correct/incorrect) continuously.
- **Leaderboard:** Compare your results with other users as well as with the "Emotion AI."

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- The following Python libraries must be installed:
  - [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
  - [python-vlc](https://www.olivieraubert.net/vlc/python-ctypes/)
    ```bash
    pip install python-vlc
    ```
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
  - [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HannesDiemerling/emotion-prediction-demo.git
   cd emotion-prediction-demo
   ```

2. **Create the Folder Structure:**  
   Inside the repository, create the following folders if they don't already exist:
   - `Daten`
   - `Daten/RAVDESS` – Place the video files (in `.mp4` format) here.
   - `Daten/MaskeRAVDESS` – Place the mask images (in `.png` format) corresponding to each clip here.

3. **CSV Files:**  
   In the `Daten` folder, add the following CSV files:
   - `Data_Labels.csv` – This file should contain the video filenames and their corresponding labels. Generated by "generate_data.py"
   - `Leaderboard.csv` – This file is automatically created/updated if it does not exist.

## Usage

Start the application with:
```bash
python main.py
```

The application offers the following functionalities:
- **User Management:** Create a new user or log out. (Upper Left)
- **Video Playback:** Plays a randomly selected video clip. (Main Screen)
- **Emotion Recognition:** Select an emotion using the provided buttons. (Down Center)
- **Feedback:** Displays the correct emotion, the model's prediction, and the corresponding mask image. (All Around)
- **Leaderboard:** View and compare your results with those of other users. (Gamifying)

## Data and Model

- **RAVDESS Dataset:** The application uses the [RAVDESS dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976) as the source of video clips.
- **Trained Model:** A model has been trained to predict emotions based on the RAVDESS data, needs to be created.
- **MaskeRAVDESS:** For each clip, a frame (mask) is displayed that highlights the facial areas most important to the model.

## Notes

- **Data Rights:** Ensure you have the rights to publish the videos and mask images used.
- **Sensitive Content:** Review the CSV files to make sure no sensitive or personal data is included.
